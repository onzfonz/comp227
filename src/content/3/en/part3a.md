<div class="content">

In this part, our ***focus shifts towards the backend*** - the server side of the stack.

We will be building our backend on top of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/),
which is a JavaScript runtime based on Google's [Chrome V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) JavaScript engine.

This course material was originally written with version *16.13.2* of Node.js,
but parts have been adapted to use that version.
If you are using NVM, you can always switch, but you can also just stick with 18.13 for now.

> **FYI:** you can check the version by running `node -v` in the command line.
> You can also check your nvm options by typing `nvm list`, `nvm install` to install a new version of node, and `nvm use` to switch that version.

As mentioned in [part 1](/part1/java_script),
browsers don't yet support the newest features of JavaScript,
and that is why the code running in the browser must be *transpiled* with e.g. [*babel*](https://babeljs.io/).
The situation with JavaScript running in the backend is different.
The newest version of Node supports a large majority of the latest features of JavaScript,
so we can use the latest features without having to transpile our code.

Our goal is to implement a backend that will work with the tasks application from [part 2](/part2/).

### Setup for part 3

Before we get started with writing code, we need to make a few adjustments to our reading docs.

What I'd like you to do is to open your previous repo that has the *reading* folder in it in WebStorm.
Once that project is open, create a new folder at the same level as your *reading* folder.
Name this new folder *backend-reading*.

We are also going to duplicate a file watcher since we will mostly be working in Javascript.
Please go to WebStorm's Settings (***Ctrl-Alt-S***).
Navigate to ***Tools->File Watchers***.
Highlight the existing *COMP 227 Git Watcher* and click the ***copy*** button in the small toolbar up top.
Clicking that button, will launch the ***New File Watcher window***.
Change the name to `COMP 227 Git Watcher Javascript`
Select the ***File type*** as `JavaScript`
and change the argument to say: `send-all "Auto-commit JS on save for 227"`
It should look like this:

![Settings showing file watchers enabled](../../images/3/custom/file_watcher_settings.png)

Click ***OK***, and ensure that both rules are selected and have the ***Global*** level.

![Settings showing file watchers enabled](../../images/3/custom/file_watchers_x2.png)

Then click ***OK*** again to close the settings.

However, let's start with the basics by implementing a classic "hello world" application.

> **Notice** that the applications and exercises in this part ***are not all React applications***,
and we will not use the *`create vite@latest -- --template react`* utility for initializing the project for this application.

We had already mentioned [npm](/part2/getting_data_from_server#npm) back in part 2, which is a tool used for managing JavaScript packages.
In fact, npm originates from the Node ecosystem.

Let's navigate to the *backend-reading* directory we created above using Terminal, and create a new template for our application using a different initialization technique.
Assuming you are at the best of your repository:

```bash
cd backend-reading
npm init
```

We will answer the questions presented by the *`npm init`* utility by pressing ***Enter*** to accept most of the defaults, except *Author*.
The result will be an automatically generated *package.json* file at the root of the project that contains information about the project.

```json
{
  "name": "backend-reading",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Osvaldo Jiménez",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

The file defines, for instance, that the entry point of the application is the *index.js* file.

Let's make a small change to the `scripts` object:

```bash
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js", // highlight-line
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Next, let's create the first version of our application by adding an *index.js* file to the root of the *backend-reading* folder with the following code:

```js
console.log('hello comp227')
```

At this point, verify that your file watcher has committed the files, which can be done by typing `git status` in the repo.
Please also **`git push`** your code here.
***Do not continue until your file watcher is working.***

We can run the program directly with Node from the command line:

```bash
node index.js
```

Or we can run it as an [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts):

```bash
npm start
```

The `start` npm script works because we defined it in the *package.json* file:

```bash
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Even though the execution of the project works when it is started by calling `node index.js` from the command line, ***it's customary for npm projects to execute such tasks as npm scripts***.

By default, the *package.json* file also defines another commonly used npm script called `npm test`.
Since our project does not yet have a testing library, the `npm test` command simply executes the following command:

```bash
echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1
```

### Simple web server

Let's change the application into a web server by editing the *index.js* file as follows:

```js
const http = require('http')

const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
  response.end('Hello COMP227!')
})

const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT)
console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
```

Once you start the application again, the following message is printed in the console:

```bash
Server running on port 3001
```

> **Warning:** if port 3001 is already in use by some other application, then starting the server will result in the following error message:
>
> ```bash
> ➜  hello npm start
>
> > hello@1.0.0 start /Users/powercat/comp227/part3/hello<br/>
> > node index.js
>
> Server running on port 3001
> events.js:167
>       throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
>       ^
>
> Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3001
>     at Server.setupListenHandle [as _listen2] (net.js:1330:14)
>     at listenInCluster (net.js:1378:12)
> ```
>
> You have two options.
> Either shut down the application using port 3001 (*json-server* in the last part of the material was using port 3001),
> or use a different port for this application.

We can open our humble application in the browser by visiting the address <http://localhost:3001>:

![hello world screen capture](../../images/3/1.png)

The text is rendered in black and white because my system is in dark mode.
The server works the same way regardless of the latter part of the URL.
Also the address <http://localhost:3001/foo/bar> will display the same content.

Let's take a closer look at the first line of the code:

```js
const http = require('http')
```

In the first row, the application imports Node's built-in [web server](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/http.html) module.
This is practically what we have already been doing in our browser-side code, but with a slightly different syntax:

```js
import http from 'http'
```

These days, code that runs in the browser uses ES6 modules.
Modules are defined with an [`export`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)
and taken into use with an [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).

However, Node.js uses so-called [*CommonJS* modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS).
The reason for this is that the Node ecosystem had a need for modules long before JavaScript supported them in the language specification.
Node supports now also the use of ES6 modules,
but since the support is yet [not quite perfect](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) ***we'll stick to the CommonJS modules***.

CommonJS modules function almost exactly like ES6 modules, at least as far as our needs in this course are concerned.

The next chunk in our code looks like this:

```js
const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
  response.end('Hello COMP227!')
})
```

The code uses the `createServer` method of the [`http` module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/http.html) to create a new web server.
An **event handler** is registered to the server that is called *every time* an HTTP request is made to the server's address <http://localhost:3001>.

The request is responded to with the status code *`200`*,
with the `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`, and the content of the site to be returned set to `Hello World`.

The last rows bind the http server assigned to the `app` variable, to listen to HTTP requests sent to port *`3001`*:

```js
const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT)
console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
```

The primary purpose of the backend server in this course is to offer raw data in JSON format to the frontend.
For this reason, let's immediately change our server to return a hardcoded list of tasks in the JSON format:

```js
const http = require('http')

// highlight-start
let tasks = [
  {
    id: 1,
    content: "Wash the dishes",
    date: "2023-01-10T17:30:31.098Z",
    important: true
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    content: "Take out the trash",
    date: "2023-01-10T18:39:34.091Z",
    important: false
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    content: "Buy salty snacks",
    date: "2023-01-10T19:20:14.298Z",
    important: true
  }
]

const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' })
  response.end(JSON.stringify(tasks))
})
// highlight-end

const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT)
console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
```

Let's restart the server (you can shut the server down by pressing ***Ctrl+C*** in the console) and let's refresh the browser.

The `application/json` value in the `Content-Type` header informs the receiver that the data is in the JSON format.
The `tasks` array gets transformed into JSON with the `JSON.stringify(tasks)` method.

When we open the browser, the displayed format is exactly the same as in [part 2](/part2/getting_data_from_server/)
where we used [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to serve the list of tasks:

![formatted JSON tasks data](../../images/3/2e.png)

### Express

Implementing our server code directly with Node's built-in [http](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/http.html) web server is possible.
However, it is cumbersome, especially once the application grows in size.

Many libraries have been developed to ease server-side development with Node,
by offering a more pleasing interface to work with the built-in http module.
These libraries aim to provide a better abstraction for general use cases we usually require to build a backend server.
By far the most popular library intended for this purpose is [*express*](http://expressjs.com).

Let's take *express* into use by defining it as a project dependency with the command:

```bash
npm i express
```

The dependency is also added to our *package.json* file:

```json
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

The source code for the dependency is installed in the *node_modules* directory located at the root of the project.
In addition to express, you can find a great number of other dependencies in the directory:

![ls listing of dependencies in directory](../../images/3/4.png)

These are the dependencies of the express library and the dependencies of all of its dependencies, and so forth.
These are called the [transitive dependencies](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/understanding-the-npm-dependency-model/) of our project.

The version 4.18.2 of express was installed in our project.
What does the caret in front of the version number in *package.json* mean?

```json
"express": "^4.18.2"
```

The versioning model used in npm is called [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning).

The caret in the front of `^4.X.Y` means that if and when the dependencies of a project are updated,
the version of express that is installed will be at least ***4.X.Y***.
However, the installed version of express can also have a larger **patch** number (the last number),
or a larger **minor** number (the middle number).
The major version of the library indicated by the first **major** number must be the same.

We can update the dependencies of the project with the command:

```bash
npm update
```

Likewise, if we start working on the project on another computer,
we can `i`nstall all up-to-date dependencies of the project defined in *package.json* by running this next command in the project's root directory:

```bash
npm i
```

If the *major* number of a dependency does not change,
then the newer versions should be [backwards compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility).
This means that if our application happened to use version *4.99.175* of express in the future,
*then all the code implemented in this part would still have to work without making changes to the code*.
In contrast, the future 5.0.0 version of express [may contain](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html) changes that would cause our application to no longer work.

### Web and express

Let's get back to our application and make the following changes in *index.js*:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

let tasks = [
  ...
]

app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.send('<h1>Hello COMP227!</h1>')
})

app.get('/api/tasks', (request, response) => {
  response.json(tasks)
})

const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

To get the new version of our application into use, we have to restart the application.

The application did not change a whole lot.
Right at the beginning of our code, we're importing `express`,
which this time is a *function* that is used to create an express application stored in the `app` variable:

> ```js
> const express = require('express')
> const app = express()
> ```

Next, we define two ***routes*** to the application.
The first one defines an event handler that is used to handle HTTP GET requests made to the application's `/` root:

> ```js
> app.get('/', (request, response) => {
>   response.send('<h1>Hello World!</h1>')
> })
> ```

The event handler function accepts two parameters.
The [`request` parameter](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req) contains all of the information of the HTTP request,
and the [`response` parameter](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) is used to define how the request is responded to.

In our code, the request is answered by using the [`send` method](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.send) of the `response` object.
Calling the method makes the server respond to the HTTP request by sending a response containing the string `<h1>Hello World!</h1>` that was passed to the `send` method.
Since the parameter is a *`string`*, *express* automatically sets the value of the `Content-Type` header to be `text/html`.
The status code of the response defaults to *`200`*.

We can verify this from the ***Network*** tab in developer tools:

![network tab in dev tools](../../images/3/5.png)

The second route defines an event handler that handles HTTP GET requests made to the *tasks* path of the application:

```js
app.get('/api/tasks', (request, response) => {
  response.json(tasks)
})
```

The request is responded to with the [json](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.json) method of the `response` object.
Calling the method will send the **tasks** array that was passed to it as a JSON formatted string.
Express automatically sets the `Content-Type` header with the appropriate value of `application/json`.

![api/tasks gives the formatted JSON data again](../../images/3/6ea.png)

Next, let's take a quick look at the data sent in JSON format.

In the earlier version where we were only using Node, we had to transform the data into the JSON format with the `JSON.stringify` method:

```js
response.end(JSON.stringify(tasks))
```

With *express*, this is no longer required, because this **transformation happens automatically**.

It's worth noting that [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is a *`string`* and not a JavaScript object like the value assigned to `tasks`.

The experiment shown below illustrates this point:

![node terminal demonstrating json is of type string](../../images/3/custom/node_demo.png)

The experiment above was done in the interactive [node-repl](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/repl.html).
You can start the interactive node-repl by typing in `node` in the command line.
The repl is particularly useful for testing how commands work while you're writing application code.
To get out of node-repl, type `.exit`.
I highly recommend this!

### nodemon

Currently, if we make changes to the backend we have to restart the server to see the changes.
We restart the server by first shutting it down by typing *Ctrl+C* and then typing *`npm start`*.
Compared to the convenient workflow in React where the browser automatically reloaded after changes were made, this is overwrought.

A solution to this problem is [*nodemon*](https://github.com/remy/nodemon):

> **nodemon** will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started,
and if any files change, *nodemon will automatically restart your node application.*

Let's install *nodemon* by defining it as a **development dependency** with the command:

```bash
npm i -D nodemon
```

The contents of *package.json* change:

```json
{
  //...
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.3"
  }
}
```

If you accidentally used the wrong command and the *nodemon* dependency was added under *`"dependencies"`* instead of *`"devDependencies"`*,
then edit *package.json* to match what is shown above.

By development dependencies, we are referring to *tools that are needed only during the development of the application*,
e.g. for testing or automatically restarting the application, like *nodemon*.

These development dependencies are not needed when the application is run in production mode on a production server (e.g. AWS).

We can start our application with *nodemon* like this:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/nodemon index.js
```

*Changes to the application code now cause the server to restart automatically.*
Even though the backend server restarts automatically, ***the browser still has to be manually refreshed***.
This is because unlike when working in React,
we don't have the [***hot reload***](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/getstarted/) functionality needed to automatically reload the browser.

To avoid remembering that bash command, let's define a dedicated npm script for *nodemon* in *package.json* instead:

```bash
{
  // ..
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",  // highlight-line
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  // ..
}
```

In the script there is no need to specify the *node_modules/.bin/nodemon* path to nodemon,
because ***npm*** *automatically knows to search for the file from that directory*.

We can now start the server in development mode with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> **FYI:** Unlike the ***start*** and ***test*** scripts, we have to add `run` to the command because it is a non-native script.

### REST

Let's expand our application so that it mimics [*json-server*'s](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#routes) RESTful HTTP API.

Representational State Transfer, aka **REST**, was introduced in 2000 in [Roy Fielding's
dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm).
REST is an architectural style meant for building scalable web applications.

We are not going to dig into Fielding's definition of REST or spend time pondering about what is and isn't RESTful.
Instead, we take a more [narrow view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_web_services)
by only concerning ourselves with *how RESTful APIs are typically understood in web applications*.
The original definition of REST is not even limited to web applications.

We mentioned in the [previous part](/part2/altering_data_in_server#rest) that singular things,
like tasks in the case of our application, are called **resources** in RESTful thinking.
*Every resource has an associated URL which is the resource's unique address*.

One convention for creating unique addresses is to ***combine the name of the resource type with the resource's unique identifier***.

Let's assume that the root URL of our service is ***`www.example.com/api`***.

If we define the resource type of task to be *`tasks`*,
then the address of a task resource with the identifier *`10`*, has the unique address ***`www.example.com/api/tasks/10`***.

The URL for the entire collection of all task resources is ***`www.example.com/api/tasks`***.

We can execute different operations on resources.
The operation to be executed is defined by the HTTP *verb*:

| URL                   | verb                | functionality                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------|
| *tasks/10*              | GET                 | fetches a single resource                                        |
| *tasks*                 | GET                 | fetches all resources in the collection                          |
| *tasks*                 | POST                | creates a new resource based on the request data                 |
| *tasks/10*              | DELETE              | removes the identified resource                                  |
| *tasks/10*              | PUT                 | replaces the entire identified resource with the request data    |
| *tasks/10*              | PATCH               | replaces a part of the identified resource with the request data |
|                       |                     |                                                                  |

This is how we have roughly defined a [**uniform interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_constraints),
which means a consistent way of defining interfaces that makes it possible for systems to cooperate.

> **FYI:** This way of interpreting REST falls under the
> [second level of RESTful maturity](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html)
> in the Richardson Maturity Model.
> According to the definition provided by Roy Fielding,
> we have not defined a [REST API](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven).
> In fact, *a large majority of the world's purported "REST" APIs do not meet Fielding's original criteria outlined in his dissertation*.

> being referred to as an example of [resource-oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture) instead of REST.

### Fetching a single resource

Let's expand our application so that it offers a REST interface for operating on individual tasks.
First, let's create a [**route**](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) for fetching a single resource.

The unique address we will use for an individual task is of the form ***tasks/10***, where the number at the end *refers to the task's unique id number*.

We can define [**parameters**](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters) for routes in express by using the `:` syntax:

```js
app.get('/api/tasks/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = request.params.id
  const task = tasks.find(task => task.id === id)
  response.json(task)
})
```

Now `app.get('/api/tasks/:id', ...)` will handle all HTTP GET requests that are of the form ***/api/tasks/SOMETHING***, where ***SOMETHING*** is an arbitrary string.

The `id` parameter in the route of a request can be accessed through the [`request`](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) object:

```js
const id = request.params.id
```

JavaScript array's `find` is used to find the task with an id that matches the parameter.
The task is then returned to the sender of the request.

When we test our application by going to <http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/1> in our browser,
we notice that it does not appear to work, as the browser displays an empty page.
This comes as no surprise to us as software developers, and it's time to debug.

As I've been doing more with live templates, I decided to modify JetBrains `log` live template ***Settings->Editor->Live Templates->JavaScript->log***.
Here's the template text that I used.
`console.log('$PARAM_TEXT$ =', $PARAM$)$END$`
Afterwards, I decided to edit the variables in the live template so they look like this:

![log template variables](../../images/3/custom/log_template.png)

Now we can add `log` commands to our code for id and task.
So type `log`, ***Enter***, `id`, ***Enter***(2x), and you get the `console.log` statement that shows below.
You could also add the line numbers and file names, but since I have `clog` already, I'll use that in those instances.

```js
app.get('/api/tasks/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = request.params.id
  console.log('id =', id)
  const task = tasks.find(task => task.id === id)
  console.log('task =', task)
  response.json(task)
})
```

When we visit <http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/1> again in the browser,
the server console - ***which is the terminal where you ran `npm run dev`*** - will display the following:

![terminal displaying 1 then undefined](../../images/3/8.png)

The `id` parameter from the route is passed to our application but the `find` method does not find a matching `task`.

To further our investigation, we also add a `console.log` inside the comparison function passed to the `find` method.
To do this, we have expand `tasks.find`'s compact arrow function syntax `task => task.id === id` to use an explicit `return` statement.
Also, while we are here, I used our `clog` and `log` live templates to generate all of the `console.log` statements.
***Try using those shortcuts here!***
Notice that even with our `log` live template, we can have some complex statements that appear twice, like `task.id === id`.

```js
app.get('/api/tasks/:id', (request, response) => {
    const id = request.params.id
    console.log('id(' + typeof id + ') =', id, ' | index.js:36 - ')
    const task = tasks.find(task => {
        console.log('task.id(' + typeof task.id + ') =', task.id, ' | index.js:38 - ')
        console.log('task.id === id =', task.id === id)
        return task.id === id
    })
    console.log('task =', task)
    response.json(task)
})
```

When we visit the URL again in the browser, each call to the comparison function prints a few different things to the console.
Here is the first part of that console output:

```shell
id(string) = 1  | index.js:36 -
task.id(number) = 1  | index.js:38 -
task.id === id = false
task.id(number) = 2  | index.js:38 -
task.id === id = false
task.id(number) = 3  | index.js:38 -
task.id === id = false
task = undefined
```

The cause of the bug becomes clear.
The `id` variable contains a string *`'1'`*, whereas the ids of tasks are integers.
In JavaScript, the "triple equals" comparison `===` considers all values of different types to not be equal by default, meaning that *`1`* is not *`'1'`*.

Let's fix the issue by changing the id parameter from a string into a [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number):

```js
app.get('/api/tasks/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = Number(request.params.id) // highlight-line
  const task = tasks.find(task => task.id === id)
  response.json(task)
})
```

Now fetching an individual resource works.

![api/tasks/1 gives a single task as JSON](../../images/3/9ea.png)

However, there's another problem with our application.

If we search for a `task` with an *id* that does not exist, the server responds with:

![network tools showing 200 and content-length 0](../../images/3/10ea.png)

The HTTP status code that is returned is *`200`*, *which means that the response succeeded*. 🐞
There is no data sent back with the response, since the value of the `content-length` header is *`0`*, and the same can be verified from the browser. 🐞

The reason for this behavior is that the `task` variable is set to `undefined` if no matching task is found.
The situation needs to be handled on the server in a better way.
If no task is found, the server should respond with the status code [404 not found](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-404-not-found) instead of *`200`*.

Let's make the following change to our code:

```js
app.get('/api/tasks/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = Number(request.params.id)
  const task = tasks.find(task => task.id === id)
  
  // highlight-start
  if (task) {
    response.json(task)
  } else {
    response.status(404).end()
  }
  // highlight-end
})
```

Since no data is attached to the response, we use the [`status` method](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.status) for setting the status and the [`end` method](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.end)
for responding to the request without sending any data.

The `if` condition leverages the fact that all JavaScript objects are [**truthy**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy),
meaning that they evaluate to true in a comparison operation.
However, `undefined` is [***falsy***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) meaning that it will evaluate to `false`.

Our application works and sends the error status code if no task is found.
However, the application doesn't return anything to show to the user, like web applications normally do when we visit a page that does not exist.
We do not need to display anything in the browser because REST APIs are interfaces that are intended for programmatic use, and the error status code is all that is needed.
  
Anyway, it's possible to give a clue about the reason for sending a 404 error by
[overriding the default NOT FOUND message](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14154337/how-to-send-a-custom-http-status-message-in-node-express/36507614#36507614).

### Deleting resources

Next, let's implement a route for deleting resources.
Deletion happens by making an HTTP DELETE request to the URL of the resource:

```js
app.delete('/api/tasks/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = Number(request.params.id)
  tasks = tasks.filter(task => task.id !== id)

  response.status(204).end()
})
```

If deleting the resource is successful, meaning that the task exists and is removed,
we respond to the request with the status code [`204` no content](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-204-no-content) and return no data with the response.

There's no consensus on what status code should be returned to a DELETE request if the resource does not exist.
The only two options are 204 and 404.
For the sake of simplicity, our application will respond with 204 in both cases.

### Postman

So how do we test the delete operation?
HTTP GET requests are easy to make from the browser.
We could write some JavaScript for testing deletion, but writing test code is not always the best solution in every situation.

Many tools exist for making the testing of backends easier.
One of these is a command line program [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se).
However, instead of curl, we will take a look at using [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com) for testing the application.
Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs, and I'm certain that some of you have heard of it already.

**If you'd like, you can install Postman following the directions below, but it is not required.**

You can install the Postman desktop client to try it out:

| Windows | Mac |
| :--- | :--- |
|`winget install -e postman` | `brew install --cask postman` |

Create an account, then a personal workspace and then create a collection.
I named my collection ***COMP 227***.
You'll then ***add a request***, which is a link provided on the side of postman.

![how to add a request in postman](../../images/3/custom/postman_quickstart.png)

While there is a lot of lingo and terminology to sift through, once you get to the request page, it becomes much more manageable.

It's enough to define the URL and then select the correct request type (DELETE).

![postman screenshot on api/tasks/2](../../images/3/11x.png)

The backend server appears to respond correctly.
By making an HTTP GET request to, or just visiting <http://localhost:3001/api/tasks>,
we see that the task with the id *`2`* is no longer in the list, which indicates that the deletion was successful.

Because the tasks in the application are only saved to memory, the list of tasks will return to its original state when we restart the application.

### WebStorm REST client

While Postman has become fairly popular due to all of its options, in our case we will just use **WebStorm's REST client instead of Postman**.

To use the rest client, right-click on the *backend-reading* folder and select ***New->HTTP Request***.
Give it the name `all_tasks` and then you'll see a file named ***all_tasks.http***.
We'll use that file to define a request that fetches all tasks.

![get all tasks rest file with get request on tasks](../../images/3/12ea.png)

By clicking the highlighted play button, the REST client will execute the HTTP request and the response from the server is opened in the ***Services*** pane.

![response from WebStorm from get request](../../images/3/13ea.png)

### Receiving data

Next, let's make it possible to add new tasks to the server.
Adding a task happens by making an HTTP POST request to the address <http://localhost:3001/api/tasks>,
and by sending all the information for the new task in the request [body](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html#sec7) in JSON format.

To access the data easily, we need the help of *express*'s [JSON parser](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html).
We can use the parser by adding the command **`app.use(express.json())`**.

Let's activate the JSON parser in *index.js* and *implement an initial handler for dealing with the HTTP POST requests*:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.use(express.json())  // highlight-line

//...

// highlight-start
app.post('/api/tasks', (request, response) => {
  const task = request.body
  console.log('task =', task)

  response.json(task)
})
// highlight-end
```

The event handler function can access the data from the `body` property of the `request` object.

Without the JSON parser, the `body` property would be `undefined`.
The JSON parser:

1. takes the JSON data of a request,
2. transforms it into a JavaScript object and
3. attaches it to the `body` property of the `request` object

It does all of this *before the route handler is called*.

> **FYI:** For the time being, the application does not do anything with the received data besides printing it to the console and sending it back in the response.

Before we implement the rest of the application logic, let's verify that the data is in fact received by the server.
To do this, we'll need to be able to send data to the server.
We'll show how to POST requests in Postman and WebStorm.

In Postman, the picture below shows how also have to define the data sent in the `body`:

![postman post on api/tasks with post content](../../images/3/14x.png)

The application prints the data that we sent in the request to the console:

![terminal printing content provided in postman](../../images/3/15e.png)

> **Remember:** *Keep the terminal window that is running nodemon visible at all times* when you are working on the backend.
Thanks to Nodemon any changes we make to the code will restart the application.
If you pay attention to the console, you will immediately be able to pick up on errors that could occur:
>
> ![nodemon error as typing require not defined](../../images/3/16.png)
>
> Similarly, it is useful to check the console for making sure that the backend behaves as we expect it to in different situations, like when we send data with an HTTP POST request.
Any `console.log` commands that you have put in temporarily for development will also appear here.
>
> A potential cause for issues is an incorrectly set `Content-Type` header in requests.
This can happen with Postman if the type of body is not defined correctly:
>
> ![postman having text as content-type](../../images/3/17x.png)
>
> The `Content-Type` header is set to `text/plain`:
>
> ![postman showing headers and content-type as text/plain](../../images/3/18x.png)
>
> The server appears to only receive an empty object:
>
> ![nodemon output showing empty curly braces](../../images/3/19.png)
>
> The server will not be able to parse the data correctly without the correct value in the header.
It won't even try to guess the format of the data since
there's a [massive amount](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) of potential *Content-Types*.

With WebStorm, the POST request can be sent as appended text in the REST client like this:

![sample post request in WebStorm with JSON data](../../images/3/20eb.png)

One benefit that the WebStorm REST client has over Postman is that the ***requests are handily available at the root of the project repository***,
and they can be distributed to everyone in the development team.

> **FYI:** Postman does allow users to save requests, but the situation can get quite chaotic especially when you're working on multiple unrelated projects.

Notice in the picture above that we are also able to add the POST request in same file using `###` separators:

```text
GET http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/

###
POST http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/ HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "name": "sample",
    "time": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT"
}
```

You can use the play button next to the line numbers to run the request you'd like.

>
> **About debugging and using requests**
>
> Sometimes when you're debugging, you may want to find out what headers have been set in the HTTP request.

> You will be able to spot this missing *Content-Type* header

Once we know that the application receives data correctly, it's time to finalize the handling of the request:

```js
app.post('/api/tasks', (request, response) => {
  const maxId = tasks.length > 0
    ? Math.max(...tasks.map(t => t.id)) 
    : 0

  const task = request.body
  task.id = maxId + 1

  tasks = tasks.concat(task)

  response.json(task)
})
```

We need a unique id for the task.
First, we find out the largest id number in the current list and assign it to the `maxId` variable.
The id of the new task is then defined as `maxId + 1`.
This method is not recommended, but we will live with it for now as we will replace it soon enough.

The current version still has the problem that the HTTP POST request can be used to add objects with arbitrary properties.
Let's improve the application by defining that the `content` property may not be empty.
The `important` and `date` properties will be given default values.
All other properties are discarded:

```js
const generateId = () => {
  const maxId = tasks.length > 0
    ? Math.max(...tasks.map(t => t.id))
    : 0
  return maxId + 1
}

app.post('/api/tasks', (request, response) => {
  const body = request.body

  if (!body.content) {
    return response.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'content missing' 
    })
  }

  const task = {
    id: generateId(),
    content: body.content,
    important: Boolean(body.important) || false,
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
  }

  tasks = tasks.concat(task)

  response.json(task)
})
```

The logic for generating the new id number for tasks has been extracted into a separate `generateId` function.

If the received data is missing a value for the `content` property, the server will respond to the request with the status code
[`400` bad request](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-400-bad-request):

```js
if (!body.content) {
  return response.status(400).json({ 
    error: 'content missing' 
  })
}
```

Notice that calling `return` is crucial because otherwise the code will execute to the very end and the malformed `task` gets saved to the application.

If the content property has a value, the task will be based on the received data.
As mentioned previously, it is better to generate timestamps on the server than in the browser,
*since we can't trust that the host machine running the browser has its clock set correctly*.
The generation of the `date` property is now done by the server.

If the `important` property is missing, we will default the value to `false`.
The default value is currently generated in a rather odd-looking way:

```js
important: Boolean(body.important) || false,
```

If the data saved in the `body` variable has the `important` property, the expression will evaluate to its value and convert it to a boolean value.
If the property does not exist, then the expression will evaluate to *`false`* which is defined on the right-hand side of the vertical lines.

> To be exact, when the `important` property is `false`,
then the `body.important || false` expression will in fact return `false` from the right-hand side...

You can find the code for our current application in its entirety in the [*part3-1* branch of our backend repo](https://github.com/comp227/part3-tasks-backend/tree/part3-1).

![GitHub screenshot of branch 3-1](../../images/3/21.png)

If you clone the project, run the `npm i` command before starting the application with `npm start` or `npm run dev`.

### Exercises 3.1-3.6

Please use this new repo link to build your new repository.

**<http://go.djosv.com/227lab3>**

> **Pertinent:** Because this is not a frontend project and we are not working with React, the application **is not created** with *`create vite@latest -- --template react`*.
You initialize this project with the `npm init` command that was demonstrated earlier in this part of the material.
>
> **Strong recommendation:** When you are working on backend code, always keep an eye on what's going on in the terminal that is running your application.

#### 3.1: Communities backend Step 1

Implement a Node application that returns a hardcoded list of community entries from the address <http://localhost:3001/api/groups>.
  
Data:
  
```js
[
    { 
      "id": 1,
      "name": "COMP 227 Students", 
      "url": "https://discord.gg/VRUKRxCJ95"
    },
    { 
      "id": 2,
      "name": "PySlackers", 
      "url": "https://pythondev.slack.com"
    },
    { 
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Code Support", 
      "url": "https://discord.gg/XQ9C3sY"
    },
    { 
      "id": 4,
      "name": "Front End Developers", 
      "url": "https://discord.gg/XHsumw2C39"
    }
]
```

Output in the browser after GET request:
  
![JSON data of 4 groups in browser from api/groups](../../images/3/22e.png)

Notice that the forward slash in the route ***api/groups*** is not a special character, and is just like any other character in the string.

The application must be started with the command `npm start`.

The application must also offer an `npm run dev` command that will run the application
and restart the server whenever changes are made and saved to a file in the source code.

#### 3.2: Communities backend Step 2

Implement a page at the address <http://localhost:3001/info> that looks roughly like this:

![Screenshot for 3.2](../../images/3/23x.png)

The page has to show the time that the request was received and how many communities are listed at the time of processing the request.

> Caution: There can only be one *`response.send()`* statement in an Express app route.
> Once you send a response to the client using *`response.send()`*, the request-response cycle is complete and no further response can be sent.
>
> To include a line space in the output, use `<br/>` tag, or wrap the statements in `<p>` tags.

#### 3.3: Communities backend Step 3

Implement the functionality for displaying the information for a community.
The URL for getting the data for a group with the ID *`5`* should be <http://localhost:3001/api/groups/5>

If an entry for the given ID is not found, the server has to respond with the appropriate status code.

#### 3.4: Communities backend Step 4

Implement functionality that makes it possible to delete a community by making an HTTP DELETE request to the unique URL of that community.

Test that your functionality works with either Postman or a REST client.

#### 3.5: Communities backend Step 5

Expand the backend so that new communities can be added by making HTTP POST requests to the address <http://localhost:3001/api/groups>.

Generate a new ID for the community with the [`Math.random` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random).
Use a big enough range for your random values so that the likelihood of creating duplicate IDs is small.

#### 3.6: Communities backend Step 6

Implement error handling for creating new entries.
The request is not allowed to succeed, if:

- The name or URL is missing
- The community name already exists

Respond to requests like these:

1. with the appropriate status code
2. with information that explains the reason for the error, e.g.:

```js
{ error: 'name must be unique' }
```

<div class="content">

### About HTTP request types

[The HTTP standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-common-method-properties)
talks about two properties related to request types, **safety** and **idempotency**.

The HTTP GET request should be **safe**:

> *In particular, the convention has been established that the **GET** and **HEAD** methods **SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval**.
  These methods ought to be considered "safe".*

Safety means that the executing request must not cause any **side effects** on the server.
By side effects, we mean that the state of the *database must not change* as a result of the request,
and the *response must only return data that already exists* on the server.

Nothing can ever guarantee that a *`GET`* request is *safe*, this is just a recommendation that is defined in the HTTP standard.
By adhering to RESTful principles in our API, *`GET`* requests are always used in a way that they are *safe*.

The HTTP standard also defines the request type [HEAD](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-head),
which ought to be safe.
In practice, *`HEAD`* should work exactly like *`GET`* but it does not return anything but the status code and response headers.
The response body will not be returned when you make a HEAD request.

All HTTP requests except *`POST`* should be **idempotent**:

> *Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues)
the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request.
  The methods `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT` and `DELETE` share this property*

This means that if a request does not generate side effects, then the result should be the same regardless of how many times the request is sent.

If we make an HTTP *`PUT`* request to the URL ***/api/tasks/10*** and with the request we send the data `{ content: "no side effects!", important: true }`,
the *result is the same regardless of how many times the request is sent*.

Like safety for the *`GET`* request, **idempotence** is also just a recommendation in the HTTP standard
and not something that can be guaranteed simply based on the request type.
However, when our API adheres to RESTful principles, then *`GET`*, *`HEAD`*, *`PUT`*, and *`DELETE`* requests are used in such a way that they are idempotent.

*`POST`* is the only HTTP request type that is neither *safe* nor *idempotent*.
If we send 5 different HTTP *`POST`* requests to ***/api/tasks*** with a body of
`{content: "many same", important: true}`, *the resulting 5 tasks on the server will all have the same content*.

### Middleware

The [JSON parser](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) in *express* we used earlier is called [*middleware*](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html).

**Middleware** are functions that can be used for handling `request` and `response` objects.

As a reminder, the JSON parser we used earlier:

- takes the raw data from the requests that are stored in the `request` object
- parses it into a JavaScript object
- assigns it to the `request` object as a new property `body`.

In practice, you can use several middlewares at the same time.
When you have more than one, they're executed one by one in the order that they were called in express.

Let's *implement our own middleware function* that prints information about every request that is sent to the server.

For a function to be **middleware** it needs to receive three parameters:

```js
const requestLogger = (request, response, next) => {
  console.log('Method:', request.method)
  console.log('Path:  ', request.path)
  console.log('Body:  ', request.body)
  console.log('---')
  next()
}
```

At the end of the function body, the `next` function that was passed as a parameter is called.
The `next` function yields control to the next middleware.

Middleware is taken into use like this:

```js
app.use(requestLogger)
```

Middleware functions are called in the order that they're taken into use with the express server object's `use` method.
Notice that the JSON parser is taken into use before the `requestLogger` middleware,
because otherwise *`request.body` will not be initialized when the logger is executed*!

Middleware functions have to be taken into use before routes *if we want them to be executed before the route event handlers* are called.
There are also situations where we want to define middleware functions *after routes*.
In practice, this means that we are defining middleware functions that are only called if no route handles the HTTP request.

Let's add the following middleware after our routes.
This middleware will be used for catching requests made to non-existent routes.
For these requests, the middleware will return an error message in the JSON format.

```js
const unknownEndpoint = (request, response, next) => {
  response.status(404).send({ error: 'unknown endpoint' })
  next()
}

app.use(unknownEndpoint)
```

### Exercises 3.7-3.8

#### 3.7: Communities backend Step 7

Add the [**morgan middleware**](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) to your application for logging.
Configure it to log messages to your console based on the `tiny` configuration.

The documentation for Morgan is not the best, and you may have to spend some time figuring out how to configure it correctly.
However, most documentation in the world falls under the same category,
so it's good to learn to decipher and interpret cryptic documentation in any case.

Morgan is installed just like all other libraries with the `npm i` command.
Taking *morgan* into use happens the same way as configuring any other middleware by using the `app.use` command.

#### 3.8*: Communities backend Step 8

Configure *morgan* so that it also shows the data sent in HTTP *`POST`* requests:

![terminal showing post data being sent](../../images/3/24.png)

Notice that logging data even in the console can be dangerous since it can contain sensitive data
and may violate local privacy laws (e.g. GDPR in the EU) or business standards.
