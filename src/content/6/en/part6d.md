<div class="content">

We will continue to look at various ways to manage an application's state.

Let's continue with our task application.
We will focus on communication with the server.
Let's start the application from scratch.
Here's version zero of our *App.jsx*:

```js
const App = () => {
  const addTask = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const content = event.target.task.value
    event.target.task.value = ''
    console.log(content)
  }

  const toggleImportance = (task) => {
    console.log('toggle importance of', task.id)
  }

  const tasks = []

  return(
    <div>
      <h2>Tasks app</h2>
      <form onSubmit={addTask}>
        <input name="task" />
        <button type="submit">add</button>
      </form>
      {tasks.map(task =>
        <li key={task.id} onClick={() => toggleImportance(task)}>
          {task.content} 
          <strong> {task.important ? '- important' : ''}</strong>
        </li>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The [initial code is on GitHub](https://github.com/comp227/query-tasks/tree/part6-0) in branch *part6-0*.

### Managing data on the server with the React Query library

We shall now use the [***React Query***](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) library to store and manage data retrieved from the server.
The latest version of the library is also called *TanStack Query*, but we'll stick to calling it *React Query*.

Install the library with the command

```bash
npm i @tanstack/react-query
```

A few additions to the file *main.jsx* are needed to pass the library functions to the entire application:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query' // highlight-line

import App from './App'

const queryClient = new QueryClient() // highlight-line

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}> // highlight-line
    <App />
  </QueryClientProvider> // highlight-line
)
```

We can now retrieve the tasks in the `App` component.
You should also copy over *db.json* from one of the other projects.
The code expands as follows:

```js
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'  // highlight-line
import axios from 'axios'  // highlight-line

const App = () => {
  // ...

   // highlight-start
  const result = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['tasks'],
    queryFn: () => axios.get('http://localhost:3001/tasks').then(res => res.data)
  })

  console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(result)))
  // highlight-end

  // highlight-start
  if ( result.isLoading ) {
    return <div>loading data...</div>
  }
  // highlight-end

  const tasks = result.data  // highlight-line

  return (
    // ...
  )
}
```

Retrieving data from the server still looks familiar as it uses Axios' `get` method.
However, the Axios method call is now wrapped in a [query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/queries)
formed with the [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useQuery) function.
`useQuery`'s first parameter is a string `tasks`, which acts as a [***key***](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/query-keys) to the query defined,
i.e. the list of tasks.

The return value of the `useQuery` function is an *object that indicates the **status of the query***.
Observe the browser's console output, which comes from our `console.log(result)` call:

![browser console output shows status object changes](../../images/6/60new.png)

The first time the component is rendered, the query is still in the *`loading`* state, i.e. the associated HTTP request is pending.
At this stage, only the following is rendered:

```js
<div>loading data...</div>
```

However, the HTTP request *is completed so quickly* that it's hard to ever see the text.
**When the request is completed, the component is rendered again**.
The query is in the state *`success`* on the second rendering, and the field `data` of the query object contains the data returned by the request,
which is the task list rendered on the screen.

So the code above *retrieves data from the server and renders it on the screen without using the React hooks `useState` and `useEffect`* used in chapters 2-5 at all.
The data on the server is now entirely under the administration of the React Query library,
and the application does not need the state defined with React's `useState` hook at all!

Let's move the function making the actual HTTP request to its own file *requests.js*

```js
import axios from 'axios'

export const getTasks = () =>
  axios.get('http://localhost:3001/tasks').then(res => res.data)
```

The `App` component is now slightly simplified

```js
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query' 
import { getTasks } from './requests' // highlight-line

const App = () => {
  // ...

  const result = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['tasks'],
    queryFn: getTasks // highlight-line
  })  

  // ...
}
```

The current code for the application is on [GitHub](https://github.com/comp227/query-tasks/tree/part6-1) in the branch *part6-1*.

This code successfully retrieves data from the server.
The next section will focus on sending data to the server.

### Synchronizing data to the server using React Query

Let's start by adding new tasks.
In *requests.js*, make a function `createTask` for saving new tasks:

```js
import axios from 'axios'

const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3001/tasks'

export const getTasks = () =>
  axios.get(baseUrl).then(res => res.data)

export const createTask = newTask => // highlight-line
  axios.post(baseUrl, newTask).then(res => res.data) // highlight-line
```

The `App` component will change as follows

```js
import { useQuery, useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query' // highlight-line
import { getTasks, createTask } from './requests' // highlight-line

const App = () => {
  const newTaskMutation = useMutation({mutationFn: createTask}) // highlight-line

  const addTask = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const content = event.target.task.value
    event.target.task.value = ''
    newTaskMutation.mutate({ content, important: true }) // highlight-line
  }

  // ...

}
```

Let's review what we added.
To create a new task, a [**mutation**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/mutations) is needed for us to modify the server's data.
We define the mutation via
[`useMutation`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useMutation):

```js
const newTaskMutation = useMutation({ mutationFn: createTask})
```

`useMutation`'s parameter is `createTask`: the function we added to *requests.js*, which merely uses Axios to send a new task to the server.

The **event handler `addTask`** performs the mutation by calling the mutation object's `mutate` method and passing in the new task (*`content, important: true`*):

```js
newTaskMutation.mutate({ content, important: true })
```

Our solution looks promising, but it doesn't work.
While the new task is saved on the server, *it is not updated on the screen*.

To render a new task, we need to tell React Query to [***invalidate***](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/invalidations-from-mutations) the old `tasks` from the query.

We can invalidate the tasks by adding a second parameter to `useMutation`.
That parameter is an `onSuccess` callback function that tells the react query to invalidate the `tasks` key.

```js
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query' // highlight-line
import { getTasks, createTask } from './requests'

const App = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient() // highlight-line

  const newTaskMutation = useMutation(createTask, {
    onSuccess: () => {  // highlight-line
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({queryKey: ['tasks']})  // highlight-line
    },
  })

  // ...
}
```

So once the mutation has been successfully executed, the function call

```js
queryClient.invalidateQueries('tasks')
```

will cause React Query to automatically fetch the `tasks` from the server.
As a result, the application renders the up-to-date state on the server, i.e. the added task is also rendered.

Let's also implement changing the importance of tasks.
Start by adding a function for updating tasks to *requests.js*:

```js
export const updateTask = updatedTask =>
  axios.put(`${baseUrl}/${updatedTask.id}`, updatedTask).then(res => res.data)
```

Updating the task is also done by mutation.
The `App` component expands as follows:

```js
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query' 
import { getTasks, createTask, updateTask } from './requests' // highlight-line

const App = () => {
  // ...

  // highlight-start
  const updateTaskMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: updateTask,
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['tasks']})
    },
  })
  // highlight-end

  // ...

  const toggleImportance = (task) => {
    updateTaskMutation.mutate({...task, important: !task.important }) // highlight-line
  }

  // ...
}
```

So again, a mutation was created that invalidated the query `tasks` so that the updated task is rendered correctly.
Using mutation is easy, the method `mutate` receives a `task` as a parameter, with the `important` property toggled.

The current code for the application is in [GitHub](https://github.com/comp227/query-tasks/tree/part6-2) in the branch *part6-2*.

### Optimizing the performance

Our application works, and the code is understandable.
It's effortless to make changes to the list of tasks too!
For example, when we change the importance of a task, invalidating the query `tasks` is enough for the application data to be updated:

```js
  const updateTaskMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: updateTask, 
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries('tasks') // highlight-line
    },
  })
```

The consequence of this, of course, is that after the PUT request that causes the task to change,
the application makes a new GET request to retrieve the query data from the server:

![devtools network tab with highlight over 3 and tasks requests](../../images/6/61new.png)

If the amount of data retrieved by the application is not large, it doesn't really matter.
Similarly, from the client's perspective, making an extra HTTP GET request doesn't matter either,
but in some situations it could strain the server.

If necessary, we could optimize performance
[by manually updating](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/updates-from-mutation-responses) the query state maintained by React Query.

Here's the code that manually updates the new task mutation:

```js
const App = () => {
  const queryClient =  useQueryClient() 

  const newTaskMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: createTask,
    // highlight-start
    onSuccess: (newTask) => {
      const tasks = queryClient.getQueryData(['tasks']) 
      queryClient.setQueryData(['tasks'], tasks.concat(newTask))
    // highlight-end
    }
  })
  // ...
}
```

In the `onSuccess` callback, *where we now have the `newTask` as a parameter*,
the `queryClient` object reads the existing `tasks` state and updates it by adding the new task.
The value of the `newTask` parameter is the *value returned by the function `createTask`*, defined in the file *requests.js* as follows:

```js
export const createTask = newTask =>
  axios.post(baseUrl, newTask).then(res => res.data)
```

It would be reasonable to make a similar change to the mutation that changes a task's importance, but we leave it as an optional exercise.

#### Noticing extra network calls

If we closely follow the browser's network tab, we notice that React Query retrieves all tasks as soon as we move the cursor to the input field:

![dev tools tasks app with input text field highlighted and arrow on network over notes request as 200](../../images/6/62new.png)

What is going on?
The [React Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useQuery),
explains that queries (*whose status is **stale***)
are updated when the **window focus** changes.
So since the input field becomes active when clicked, that changes the window focus, and thus the queries update.
If we want, we can turn off the functionality by adding an *options* parameter to our `getTasks` query.

```js
const App = () => {
  // ...
  const result = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['tasks'],
    queryFn: getTasks,
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false  // highlight-line
  })

  // ...
}
```

If you put a `console.log` statement in the code, you could see from browser console how often React Query causes the application to be re-rendered.
The rule of thumb is that rerendering happens at least whenever there is a need for it, i.e. when the state of the query changes.
You can read more about [render optimizations here](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-query-render-optimizations).

The code for the application is in [GitHub](https://github.com/comp227/query-tasks/tree/part6-3) in the branch *part6-3*.

#### React Query summary

React Query is a versatile library that, based on what we have already seen, simplifies the application.
Does React Query make more complex state management solutions such as Redux unnecessary? No.
React Query can partially replace the state of the application in some cases,
but as the [documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/does-this-replace-client-state) states:

>- *React Query is a **server-state library**, responsible for managing asynchronous operations between your server and client*
>- *Redux, etc. are **client-state libraries** that can be used to store asynchronous data, albeit inefficiently when compared to a tool like React Query*

So React Query is a **library that maintains the server state in the frontend**, i.e. acts as a cache for what is stored on the server.
React Query simplifies the processing of data on the server, and can in some cases eliminate the need for data on the server to be saved in the frontend state.

Most React applications need not only a way to temporarily store the served data,
but also some solution for how the rest of the frontend state (e.g. the state of forms or notifications) is handled.

### Exercises 6.20-6.22

Now let's make a new version of the joke application that uses the React Query library.
Use the *quipquery* folder in your *part6* repo as your starting point in your project.
The project has a ready-installed JSON Server, the operation of which has been slightly modified.
*Read **server.js** for more details.*
*Also, make sure you're connecting to the correct `PORT`.*
Start the server with `npm run server`.

#### Exercise 6.20

Implement retrieving jokes from the server using React Query.

The application should work in such a way that if there are problems communicating with the server, only an error page will be displayed:

![browser saying anecdote service not available due to problems in server on localhost](../../images/6/65new.png)

Here is some [info on how to detect possible server errors](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/queries).

> *You can simulate a problem with the server by **turning off the JSON Server.***

Please be aware that if a request fails, the query stays in the `isLoading` state for a while.
This is because React Query tries the request a few times before it determines that the request is not successful.
You can optionally specify that no retries are made:

```js
const result = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['jokes'],
    queryFn: getJokes, 
    retry: false
  }
)
```

or that the request is retried a specific number of times (*like once*):

```js
const result = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['jokes'],
    queryFn: getJokes, 
    retry: 1
  }
)
```

#### Exercise 6.21

Implement adding new jokes to the server using React Query.
The application should render a new joke by default.
Make sure that the content of the joke must be at least five characters long, otherwise the server will reject the POST request.
You don't have to worry about error handling now.

#### Exercise 6.22

Implement voting for jokes using React Query.
The application should automatically render the increased number of votes for the voted joke

</div>

<div class="content">

### useReducer

So even if the application uses React Query, some kind of solution is usually needed to manage the rest of the frontend state (for example, the state of forms).
Quite often, the state created with `useState` is a sufficient solution.
Using Redux is of course possible, but there are other alternatives.

Let's look at a simple counter application.
The application displays the counter value, and offers three buttons to update the counter status:

![browser showing simple counter application with + - 0 buttons and 7 above](../../images/6/63new.png)

Let's implement the state management of the counter *using a Redux-like state management mechanism* provided by React's built-in
[***useReducer***](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) hook.
Here's what the code looks like:

```js
import { useReducer } from 'react'

const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INC":
        return state + 1
    case "DEC":
        return state - 1
    case "ZERO":
        return 0
    default:
        return state
  }
}

const App = () => {
  const [counter, counterDispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => counterDispatch({ type: "INC"})}>+</button>
        <button onClick={() => counterDispatch({ type: "DEC"})}>-</button>
        <button onClick={() => counterDispatch({ type: "ZERO"})}>0</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The hook [`useReducer`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) provides a mechanism to create a state for an application.
`useReducer`'s first parameter, is the reducer function that handles state changes, while the second parameter is the initial value of the state:

```js
const [counter, counterDispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0)
```

The reducer function that handles state changes is similar to Redux's reducers,
i.e. the function takes in *parameters for the current state and the action that changes the state*.
The function returns the new state updated based on the type and possible contents of the action:

```js
const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INC":
        return state + 1
    case "DEC":
        return state - 1
    case "ZERO":
        return 0
    default:
        return state
  }
}
```

In our example, actions only have a type.
*If the action's type is `INC`, it increases the value of the counter by one, etc.*
Like Redux's reducers, ***actions can also contain arbitrary data***, which is usually put in the action's `payload` field.

The function `useReducer` returns an array that contains:

1. an element to access the current value of the state
2. a `dispatch` function to change the state:

```js
const App = () => {
  const [counter, counterDispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0)  // highlight-line

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div> // highlight-line
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => counterDispatch({ type: "INC" })}>+</button> // highlight-line
        <button onClick={() => counterDispatch({ type: "DEC" })}>-</button>
        <button onClick={() => counterDispatch({ type: "ZERO" })}>0</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

One can observe that the state change is done exactly as in Redux, the dispatch function is given the appropriate state-changing action as a parameter:

```js
counterDispatch({ type: "INC" })
```

The current code for the application is in the repository
[https://github.com/comp227/hook-counter](https://github.com/comp227/hook-counter/tree/part6-1) in the branch *part6-1*.

### Using context for passing the state to components

If we want to split the application into several components,
*the value of the counter and the dispatch function used to manage it must also be passed to the other components*.
One solution would be to ***pass these as props*** in the usual way:

```js
const Display = ({ counter }) => {
  return <div>{counter}</div>
}

const Button = ({ dispatch, type, label }) => {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type })}>
      {label}
    </button>
  )
}

const App = () => {
  const [counter, counterDispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0)

  return (
    <div>
      <Display counter={counter}/> // highlight-line
      <div>
        // highlight-start
        <Button dispatch={counterDispatch} type='INC' label='+' />
        <Button dispatch={counterDispatch} type='DEC' label='-' />
        <Button dispatch={counterDispatch} type='ZERO' label='0' />
        // highlight-end
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The solution works, but is not optimal.
If the component structure becomes very nested, the dispatcher would need to be forwarded using props through all of those intermediary sub-components,
even though those components in between may not need the dispatcher.
This phenomenon is called [**prop drilling**](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling).

React's built-in [Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) provides a solution for us.
React's **context** is like a global state for the application, so that any component could get access to the state.
However, as Javascript expert Kent Dodds says in the [prop drilling article linked above](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling), when comparing the context api to global variables:

>*The difference is that because of the way the [Context] API was designed, you can still statically find the source of the context as well as any consumers with relative ease.*

Let us now create a context in the application that stores the state management of the counter.

The context is created with React's hook [createContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext).
Let's create a context in the file *CounterContext.jsx*:

```js
import { createContext } from 'react'

const CounterContext = createContext()

export default CounterContext
```

The `App` component can now ***provide a context to its child components*** as follows:

```js
import CounterContext from './CounterContext' // highlight-line

const App = () => {
  const [counter, counterDispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0)

  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={[counter, counterDispatch]}>  // highlight-line
      <Display />
      <div>
        <Button type='INC' label='+' />
        <Button type='DEC' label='-' />
        <Button type='ZERO' label='0' />
      </div>
    </CounterContext.Provider> // highlight-line
  )
}
```

The code above wraps child components inside the `CounterContext.Provider` component and sets a `value` in its attributes.

The context providers's `value` is set to be an array containing the value of the `counter`, and the `dispatch` function (*`counterDispatch`*).

Other components (including *`Display`* and *`Button`*)
can now access the context using the [`useContext`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) hook:

```js
import { useContext } from 'react' // highlight-line
import CounterContext from '../CounterContext'

const Display = () => {
  const [counter, dispatch] = useContext(CounterContext) // highlight-line
  return (
    <div>
      {counter}
    </div>
  )
}

// meanwhile in another component, Button.jsx
const Button = ({ type, label }) => {
  const [counter, dispatch] = useContext(CounterContext) // highlight-line
  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type })}>
      {label}
    </button>
  )
}
```

The current code for the application is in [GitHub](https://github.com/comp227/hook-counter/tree/part6-2) in the branch *part6-2*.

### Defining the counter context in a separate file

In studying the application's code further,
we want to avoid the fact that the functionality of the counter state management is partly defined in the `App` component.
Let's **move everything related to the counter to *CounterContext.jsx***:

```js
import { createContext, useReducer } from 'react'

const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INC":
        return state + 1
    case "DEC":
        return state - 1
    case "ZERO":
        return 0
    default:
        return state
  }
}

const CounterContext = createContext()

export const CounterContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [counter, counterDispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0)

  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={[counter, counterDispatch] }>
      {props.children}
    </CounterContext.Provider>
  )
}

export default CounterContext
```

The file now exports, in addition to the `CounterContext` object, the `CounterContextProvider` component,
whose value is a counter and a dispatcher used for its state management.

Let's enable the context provider by making a change in *main.jsx*:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import { CounterContextProvider } from './CounterContext' // highlight-line

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <CounterContextProvider>  // highlight-line
    <App />
  </CounterContextProvider>  // highlight-line
)
```

Now the context defining the value and functionality of the counter **is available to *all* components of the application**.

The `App` component is simplified to the following form:

```js
import Display from './components/Display'
import Button from './components/Button'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Display />
      <div>
        <Button type='INC' label='+' />
        <Button type='DEC' label='-' />
        <Button type='ZERO' label='0' />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The context is still used in the same way, e.g. the component `Button` is defined as follows:

```js
import { useContext } from 'react'
import CounterContext from '../CounterContext'

const Button = ({ type, label }) => {
  const [counter, dispatch] = useContext(CounterContext)
  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type })}>
      {label}
    </button>
  )
}

export default Button
```

The `Button` component *only needs the `dispatch` function of the counter*, but it also gets the value of the counter from the context using the function `useContext`:

```js
  const [counter, dispatch] = useContext(CounterContext)
```

This is not a big problem, but it is possible to make the code a bit nicer by defining a couple of helper functions in the `CounterContext` file:

```js
import { createContext, useReducer, useContext } from 'react' // highlight-line

const CounterContext = createContext()

// ...

export const useCounterValue = () => {
  const counterAndDispatch = useContext(CounterContext)
  return counterAndDispatch[0]
}

export const useCounterDispatch = () => {
  const counterAndDispatch = useContext(CounterContext)
  return counterAndDispatch[1]
}

// ...
```

With these helper functions, the components can now selectively retrieve the parts of the context they need.
The `Display` component changes as follows:

```js
import { useCounterValue } from '../CounterContext' // highlight-line

const Display = () => {
  const counter = useCounterValue() // highlight-line
  return <div>
    {counter}
  </div>
}


export default Display
```

Component `Button` becomes:

```js
import { useCounterDispatch } from '../CounterContext' // highlight-line

const Button = ({ type, label }) => {
  const dispatch = useCounterDispatch() // highlight-line
  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type })}>
      {label}
    </button>
  )
}

export default Button
```

This code is much cleaner.
The *entire state of the application*, i.e. the value of the counter and the code for managing it, ***is now isolated in the file `CounterContext`***.
*CounterContext.jsx* also has well-named and easy-to-use auxiliary functions for managing the state.

The final code for the application is in [GitHub](https://github.com/comp227/hook-counter/tree/part6-3) in the branch *part6-3*.

As a technical detail, notice that the helper functions `useCounterValue` and `useCounterDispatch` are defined as
[custom hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks),
because calling the hook function `useContext` is [possible](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) only from React components or custom hooks.
**Custom Hooks** are JavaScript functions whose name must start with the string *`use`*.
We will return to custom hooks in a little more detail in [part 7](/part7/custom_hooks) of the course.

### Exercises 6.23-6.24

#### Exercise 6.23

The application has a `Notification` component for displaying notifications to the user.

Implement the application's notification state management using the `useReducer` hook and context.
The notification should tell the user when a new joke is created or an joke is voted on:

![browser showing notification for added joke](../../images/6/66new.png)

The notification is displayed for five seconds.

#### Exercise 6.24

As stated in exercise 6.21, the server requires that the content of the joke to be added is at least five characters long.
***Now implement error handling for the insertion***.
In practice, it is sufficient to display a notification to the user in case of a failed POST request:

![browser showing error notification for trying to add too short of an anecdote](../../images/6/67new.png)

The error condition should be handled in the callback function registered for it, here's
[how to register a function](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useMutation).

This was the last exercise for this part of the course and it's time to push your code to GitHub if you haven't already and mark the exercises that were completed on Canvas.

### Which state management solution to choose?

In chapters 1-5, all state management of the application was done using React's hook `useState`.
Asynchronous calls to the backend required the use of the `useEffect` hook in some situations.
In principle, *nothing else is needed*.

However as we have discussed in this section, the idea of *prop drilling* or of wanting a more complex state management solution has often arisen.

Over the years, several alternative solutions have been developed for state management of React applications.
However, no solution has been "final", all have their own pros and cons, and new solutions are being developed all the time.

The situation may confuse a beginner and even an experienced web developer.
Which solution should be used?

For a simple application, `useState` is certainly a good starting point.
If the application is communicating with the server, the communication can be handled in the same way as in chapters 1-5, using the state of the application itself.
Recently, however, it has become more common to move the communication and associated state management at least partially under the control of React Query (or some other similar library).
There are also situations where it may make sense to handle some of the state with `useState` and some with contexts.

The most comprehensive and robust state management solution is *Redux*, which is a way to implement the so-called [Flux](https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux/) architecture.
Redux is slightly older than the solutions presented in this section.
The rigidity of Redux has been the motivation for many new state management solutions, such as React's `useReducer`.
Some of the criticisms of Redux's rigidity have already become obsolete thanks to the [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

Over the years, there have also been other state management libraries developed that are similar to Redux,
such as the newer entrant [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) and the slightly older [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/).
However, according to [Npm trends](https://npmtrends.com/mobx-vs-recoil-vs-redux),
Redux still clearly dominates, and in fact seems to be increasing its lead:

![graph showing redux growing in popularity over past 5 years](../../images/6/64new.png)

Also, Redux does not have to be used in its entirety in an application.
It may make sense, for example, *to manage the form state outside of Redux*, especially in situations where the state of a form does not affect the rest of the application.
It is also possible to ***use Redux and React Query together in the same application***.

The question of which state management solution should be used is not at all straightforward.
**It is impossible to give a single correct answer**.
It may also turn out that over time, the application may outgrow the selected state management solution,
*even if the application has already been put into production use*.

The best we can do is to continue to learn about what's available.
