#### Important Tips for Success as an Online Learner

- Begin planning now for private, uninterrupted time in your schedule to go through the course materials and complete the assignments
    - preferably in at least two-hour blocks and at least five times a week.
It can be easy to fall behind!
- Check your email account and the class [discord](https://discord.gg/VRUKRxCJ95) regularly for updated information.
- Use Discord for private messages to the instructor.
Discord is a great place to ask questions in the correct categories (make sure you read the rules there).
- If you have questions or are confused about an assignment, act promptly! Check #announcements, #help or #sos to see if your concern has been addressed already.
If not, post your question to this discussion.
- We may use Canvas tools such as WebEx for Q&A sessions and please follow the instructions the instructor sends out through Canvas Announcement.
- Read directions carefully.

For posts to online discussions, conventions of online etiquette ("netiquette") which include courtesy to all users, will be observed.
Please see Guidelines for Online Discussion for details.

### Discord & Course Netiquette

You can discuss the course and related topics in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VRUKRxCJ95).
Discord will have different channels for both your learning partners as well as course-related conversations.
You will be expected to be active on Discord!
If you have not used Discord before, then you can review their [official beginner's guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).
However, I think merely using the software is the best way to learn it.

For those of you who are new to online learning and online discussion, there are some important differences between how you communicate online and in the classroom.
These differences are frequently the cause of misunderstandings in courses that have an online component.
The following guidelines are intended to help you understand the differences and communicate in a way that minimizes the chances of misunderstandings.

#### Remember you cannot see each other

The most important difference between face-to-face communication and using an online discussion is that you cannot see each other.
For the most part, humans rely on visual and audio cues when talking to each other.
When we speak face to face we can interpret what the other person is saying through their posture, tone of voice, and expression.
All of this is missing when communicating through discussion forums.
You can’t easily tell what the intent is when reading a response to a message in a discussion board.
There are no visual cues.
There is no tone of voice to convey emotion.
There is only text.
It is easy to make assumptions about a person’s intent when you are lacking the cues that you would take for granted otherwise.
Below are some guidelines for communication in online courses that will help you make the most out of your online interactions.

#### Keep a positive tone

Everyone in your class is there to learn, just as you are.
Discussions are a great way to understand different perspectives.
If a conversation remains positive, then it is a lot more likely that everyone will get something useful out of it.
Avoid any language that can be construed as angry, sarcastic, or even humorous.

#### Don’t take things personally

As mentioned above, there is no way for you to know for sure what that person writing intends.
Given that the discussions are supposed to be a community-building experience, assume that the responses are meant to be helpful.
If you have questions about a post, contact your instructor.

#### When in doubt, take a break before posting

If you do find yourself becoming emotionally involved in the discussion, take a break for a half hour.
Then revisit what you were about to post with an eye to how others would interpret it.
Once you post a message there is no deleting or taking it back.

#### Be patient, few are online 24/7

Remember that all the people in your course have lives outside of the class they are taking.
If you ask a question or need clarification, it may be a day or two before you get a response.
As for me, I vow that I'll respond to you as quickly as I can, but I am not always available immediately.

#### Help others

You are all in this together.
If someone in the course has a problem with the system or needs help in another way, feel free.
Many of you will have more experience and your assistance will be appreciated.

### Attendance policies

Even though this is an asynchronous online course, attendance will be counted by how responsive you are on Discord.
You will be expected to respond to any discussion via Discord in a reasonable time frame (24-48 hours).
After having to contact you via other methods or bringing responsiveness in discord to your attention,
any subsequent attempts to contact you will lower part of your social learning exercises grade by two percentage points.
In addition to me reaching out, you will be expected to:

- Be in contact with others via our official discord server channels.
- Communicate in those discord channels with your learning groups regularly.
- Meet with your learning groups regularly to go over the material.
    - *This means that you'll be expected to meet online with those groups either over Discord or via Zoom (or in person if you prefer).*

**Chatting privately via DMs will not count towards your expectations of regular communication.**
Those meetings are crucial to your learning and your peers, and so you will be expected to make them up if you cannot make it, or forfeit your ability to pass the course.

### Pronouns

Knowing and applying the names and pronouns that students use is a crucial part of developing a productive learning environment
that fosters safety, inclusion, personal dignity, and a sense of belonging across campus.
Please let me know your preferred name and pronoun anytime throughout the semester.

### Grading Scale

The following minimum percentages are required to achieve the corresponding grades:

| A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 93 | 90 | 87 | 83 | 80 | 77 | 73 | 70 | 63 |

The grading will come from these areas, however, the percentages are tentative and subject to change.

|   |   |
| - | - |
| Individual Exercises |  45%  |
| Social Learning Exercises & Attendance | 20% |
| Final Project | 25% |
| Other Activities | 10% |

### Major Assignments and Examinations

The course is composed of a few parts

- Individual Exercises
- Social Learning Exercises
- Final Project
- Other Activities
- Course Exam

#### Individual Exercises

Part of your grade for the course will be based on the total number of submitted exercises for the required parts (including exercises marked with an asterisk).
For all of the exercises, your work will not only come from the solution but from you showing your work as you move toward your solution.

**Your grade will not completely come from these exercises**.

We will be having other exercises and assignments as well that will be just as important to your grade.

Assume that if there are 138 exercises **(there are not 138 exercises; that count is not final)**, a rough calculation for this portion is as follows:

| exercises    | approx grade for exercises    |
| ------------ | :------: |
| 138          | A?        |
| 127          | B+?        |
| 116          | B?        |
| 105          | C?        |
| 94           | C-?       |
| 83           | D?        |
| 72           | F?        |

Why did I put it this way? Because this is a guideline, not a contract.
I don't even know if there are 138 exercises to begin with!
Nevertheless, I wanted to provide this approximation to you so that you have a better understanding of what the expectations look like.
Also, realize that what is more important here is a continual amount of progress each week.
This means that if you get stuck during a week, that is OK, but you'll need to do extra to catch up.
How much you can catch up per week will also be capped, to no more than 10% of the exercises that you have left to do.
If you wish to pass the course, you will need to work regularly and submit the assignments as listed in Canvas.

For the other modules, we will determine at a later date which ones will be completed, but these may be done in a different order sequence.

| Additional Modules | Module name | Minimum Exercises to submit | work needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6  | Redux | 24 | 1 |
| 7  | React router, hooks & styling | 24 | 1 |
| 8  | TypeScript | 24 | 1 |

With all submissions requested, please follow submission guidelines carefully.

Students are responsible for reading course material and following instructions posts on Canvas.
Students are also responsible for being aware of any announcements the instructor makes through Canvas.

#### Course Exam

You must also complete the course exam.
Notice though that the exam is not listed in your grade breakdown.
The exam does not count towards your final grade, but you must pass it to pass the course.
More info about the exam will be discussed via Canvas and Discord in the middle of the semester.

You can only take the exam after submitting a sufficient number of exercises.
It is not wise in practice to take the exam immediately after submitting the critical number of exercises.
The exam is the same and does not count toward your grade (you just need to pass it).

If you complete the assignments and you work through the material in earnest, you will be fine on the exam.

#### Late Assignments and Make-up Work

The only acceptable excuses for missing an assignment due date are serious illness, death in the immediate family or important professional activities.
Illness or death in the family may require documentation.
Excuses for professional activities must be approved by the instructor in advance.
Late assignments other than the individual exercises will be deducted 15% per day and will not be accepted beyond 1 week late.

Individual exercises will follow a different policy.
Exercises are broken into Canvas assignments.
Students must submit one part before unlocking subsequent parts.
There is no late penalty to submit a part.
However, there is a cap on how many individual exercises can be submitted in a given week, which is 10% more than the regular workload.
This means that falling behind greatly will impact your chances of finishing all of the exercises for credit.
Your focus on that point with the individual exercises should be to focus on your current understanding.
All work will have a hard cutoff that will be outlined in Canvas.

#### Individual Work and Collaboration

Computer professionals usually work in a cooperative environment, yet proper assessment requires that work be done by individuals.
To alleviate confusion, the following policy will be followed:

Collaborative work is encouraged.
This includes students working together on problem sets, planning solution strategies, and helping each other to debug programs.
Collaboration must stop short of the writing of program code or English that represents your work.
You may not directly copy the work of another student.
It is your responsibility to ensure that the work you submit is an honest representation of your own understanding of the material.

Marginal cases will be resolved by oral examination of the students involved.
If they understand the material in the assignment, it will be considered honest collaboration.
If they do not, then it will be considered academic dishonesty.

### Collection of Work for Assessment

Student work may be retained to assess how course learning objectives are being met and for accreditation purposes.
Copies of student work may be retained to assess how the learning objectives of the course are being met.

### Honor Code

The Honor Code at the University of the Pacific calls upon each student to exhibit a high degree of maturity, responsibility, and personal integrity.
Students are expected to:

- act honestly in all matters
- actively encourage academic integrity
- discourage any form of cheating or dishonesty by others
- inform the instructor and appropriate university administrator
  if they have a reasonable and good faith belief and substantial evidence that a violation of the Academic Honesty Policy has occurred.

Violations will be referred to and investigated by the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards.
If a student is found responsible, it will be documented as part of her or his permanent academic record.
A student may receive a range of penalties, including failure of an assignment, failure of the course, suspension, or dismissal from the University.
The Academic Honesty Policy is located in Tiger Lore and online at <https://www.pacific.edu/student-life/student-conduct/tiger-lore>

You will be expected to conduct yourself according to professional ethics, just as if this were a real-world job.
With this course focused on exercises,
***you may not ask others (including computers) for solutions or to partially solve any of the individual exercises***,
This also applies to search tools, AI services and other humans, whether hired, friends or classmates.
You MAY ask others (both computers and humans)
for help understanding particular errors that appear, or in explaining high-level concepts that you feel the text does not explain well.
However, those concepts should not contain the exercise text.
You should be able to explain any of the code you write and you also need to cite anything longer than a line of code that you get from the internet.
Provide links to any code and tutorials that you find that help you program.  
Make sure to cite and credit code, libraries, videos, ideas, or other resources that are not provided directly from this website.
Honor code cases will be resolved by an oral examination of the understanding of the material.
just as a professional would need to credit the source or fully understand code when receiving help from others.
Students are expected to participate as a team, with fair credit given according to effort and participation.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you are a student with a disability who requires accommodations,
please contact the Director of the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) for information on how to obtain an Accommodations Request Letter.

#### 3-Step Accommodation Process
