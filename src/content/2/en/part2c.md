<div class="content">

For a while now we have only been working on "frontend", i.e. client-side (browser) functionality.
We will begin working on "backend", i.e. server-side functionality in the [third part](/part3) of this course.
Nonetheless, we will now take a step in that direction by familiarizing ourselves with how the code executing in the browser communicates with the backend.

Let's use a tool meant to be used during software development called [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to act as our server.

Create a file named *db.json* in the root directory of our *reading* project with the following content:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "content": "Wash the dishes",
      "date": "2022-1-17T17:30:31.098Z",
      "important": true
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "content": "Take out the trash",
      "date": "2022-1-17T18:39:34.091Z",
      "important": false
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "content": "Buy salty snacks",
      "date": "2022-1-17T19:20:14.298Z",
      "important": true
    }
  ]
}
```

You can run a JSON server in two ways.

One way is to [install](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#getting-started) a JSON server globally on your machine using the command `npm i -g json-server`.
A global installation requires administrative privileges, which means that it is not possible on school computers.

After installing run the following command to run the json-server.
The *json-server* starts running on port *`3000`* by default;
The `--watch` option automatically looks for any saved changes to *db.json*.
Nonetheless, we will now define an alternate port *`3001`* for the json-server.
  
```js
json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json
```

> **Pertinent:** If you get a security prompt from your firewall, make sure you allow access to port 3001.

Another way to run a JSON server *does not require a global installation*.
From the root directory of your app, we can run the *json-server* using the command `npx`:

```js
npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json
```

Let's navigate to the address <http://localhost:3001/tasks> in the browser.
We can see that *json-server* serves the tasks we previously wrote to the file in JSON format:

![json data of tasks](../../images/2/14e.png)

> **Pertinent:** If your browser doesn't display the data as nicely as you see above, install an appropriate plugin,
like [JSONVue](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) to make your life easier.

Going forward, we will want to save the tasks ***to the server***, which in this case means saving them to the json-server.
We also want the React code to fetch the tasks from the server and render them to the screen.
Whenever a new task is added to the application, we will want the React code to send it to the server to make the new task persist in "memory".

*json-server* stores all the data in the *db.json* file, which ***resides on the "server"***.
In the real world, **data would be stored in some kind of database**.
However, *json-server* is a handy tool during development because it ***mimics server-side functionality without needing to program any of it***.

We will get familiar with the principles of implementing server-side functionality in more detail in [part 3](/part3) of this course.

### The browser as a runtime environment

Our first task is fetching the already existing tasks to our React application from the address <http://localhost:3001/tasks>.

In [part 0's example project](/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#running-application-logic-in-the-browser),
we already learned a way to fetch data from a server using JavaScript.
The code in the example was fetching the data using [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest),
otherwise known as an HTTP request made using an XHR object.
This is a technique introduced in 1999, which every browser has supported for a good while now.

**The use of XHR is no longer recommended**, and browsers already widely support the
[`fetch` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch),
which is based on [*promises*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise),
instead of the event-driven model used by XHR.

As a reminder from part0, data was fetched ⚠️ using XHR ⚠️ in the following way:

```js
const xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest() // ☣️

xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { // ☣️
  if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
    const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText)
    // handle the response that is saved in variable data
  }
}

xhttp.open('GET', '/data.json', true) // ☣️
xhttp.send() // ☣️
```

Right at the beginning, we register an *event handler* to the `xhttp` object representing the HTTP request,
which will be called by the JavaScript runtime whenever the state of the `xhttp` object changes.
If the change in state means that the response to the request has arrived, then the data is handled accordingly.

It is worth noting that the code in the event handler is defined before the request is sent to the server.
Despite this, the code within the event handler will be executed at a later point in time.
Therefore, the code does not execute synchronously "from top to bottom", but does so **asynchronously**.
JavaScript calls the event handler that was registered for the request at some point.

A synchronous way of making requests that's common in Java programming, for instance,
would play out as follows:

```java
HTTPRequest request = new HTTPRequest();

String url = "https://comp227-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/data.json";
List<Task> tasks = request.get(url);

tasks.forEach(m => {
  System.out.println(m.content);
});
```

> **Disclaimer**: this is not actually working Java code

In Java, the code executes line by line and stops to wait for the HTTP request, which means waiting for the command `request.get(...)` to finish.
The data returned by the command, in this case the tasks, are then stored in a variable, and we begin manipulating the data in the desired manner.

In contrast, JavaScript engines, or runtime environments, follow the [asynchronous model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop).
In principle, this requires almost all
[Input/Output (I/O) operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output) to be executed as non-blocking.
This means that code execution continues immediately after calling an I/O function, ***without waiting for it to return***.

When an asynchronous operation is completed, or, more specifically, at some point after its completion,
the JavaScript engine calls the event handlers registered to the operation.

Currently, JavaScript engines are **single-threaded**, which means that they cannot execute code in parallel.
As a result, it is a requirement in practice to **use a non-blocking model for executing I/O operations**.
Otherwise, the browser would "freeze" during, for instance, the fetching of data from a server.

Another consequence of this single-threaded nature of JavaScript engines is that if some code execution takes up a lot of time, the browser will get stuck for the duration of the execution.
If we added the following code at the top of our application:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('loop..')
  let i = 0
  while (i < 50000000000) {
    i++
  }
  console.log('end')
}, 5000)
```

everything would work normally for 5 seconds.
However, when the function defined as the parameter for `setTimeout` is run,
the *browser will be stuck for the duration of the execution of the long loop*.
Even the browser tab cannot be closed during the execution of the loop, at least not in Chrome.

For the browser to remain **responsive**, i.e., to be able to continuously react to user operations with sufficient speed,
**no single computation in the code can take too long**.

There is a host of additional material on the subject to be found on the internet.
For example, Philip Roberts clearly explains event loops in his presentation,
[What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

In today's browsers, it is possible to run parallelized code with the help of
[**web workers**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).
The event loop of an individual browser window is, however, still only handled by a
[single thread](https://medium.com/techtrument/multithreading-javascript-46156179cf9a).

### npm

Let's get back to the topic of fetching data from the server.

We could use the previously mentioned promise-based function
[`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch)
to pull the data from the server.
Fetch is a wonderful tool.
It is standardized and supported by all modern browsers (excluding IE).

That being said, we will be using the [*axios*](https://github.com/axios/axios) library instead for communication between the browser and server.
It functions like `fetch` but is somewhat more pleasant to use.
Another good reason to use axios is to familiarize ourselves with adding external libraries, so-called *npm packages*, to React projects.

Nowadays, practically all JavaScript projects are defined using the node package manager, aka [***npm***](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm).
The projects created using Vite also follow the npm format.
A clear indicator that a project uses npm is the *package.json* file located at the root of the project:

```json
{
  "name": "tasks",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.2.43",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.17",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.2.1",
    "eslint": "^8.55.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.33.2",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.6.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react-refresh": "^0.4.5",
    "vite": "^5.0.8"
  }
}
```

Notice the `dependencies` section.
It defines what **dependencies**, or external libraries, the project has.

We now want to use axios.
Theoretically, we could add the library directly into the *package.json* file, but it is better to install it from the command line.

```js
npm i axios
```

> **FYI:** `npm i axios` is shorthand for `npm install axios`.
> I may go back and forth between the two as they can be used interchangeably.
>
>> **Remember that *`npm`* commands should always be run in the project's root directory**,
>> which is where the *package.json* file can be found.

Axios is now included among the other dependencies:

```json
{
  "name": "tasks",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.6.5", // highlight-line
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  // ...
}
```

In addition to adding axios to the dependencies, the `npm i` command also ***downloaded*** the library code.
As with other dependencies, the code can be found in the *node_modules* directory located in the root.
As one might have noticed, *node_modules* contains a fair amount of interesting stuff.

Let's make another addition.
Install *json-server* as a development dependency (only used during development) by executing the command:

```js
npm i -D json-server
```

> **FYI:** `-D` is shorthand for `--save-dev` and this flag can be put before or after the name of the package you want to install.

and making a small addition to the *scripts* part of the *package.json* file:

```json
{
  // ...

  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "server": "json-server -p3001 --watch db.json" // highlight-line
  },
}
```

We can now conveniently, without parameter definitions, start the json-server from the project root directory with the command:

```js
npm run server
```

> **Pertinent** The previously started *json-server* must be terminated before starting a new one; otherwise, there will be trouble:
>
> ![cannot bind to port 3001 error](../../images/2/15b.png)
>
> The error message provides some information about the issue:
>
> *EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001*
>
> From this we could deduce that the application is not able to bind itself to the [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)),
because **port `3001` is already occupied by the previously started `json-server`**.

#### The nuances of npm

We used the command `npm i` twice, but with slight differences:

```js
npm i axios
npm i -D json-server
```

There is a slight difference in the parameters.
*axios* is `i`nstalled as a **runtime dependency** of the application because the execution of the program requires the existence of the library.
On the other hand, *json-server* was `i`nstalled as a **development dependency** (`-D`),
since the program itself doesn't require it.
Development dependencies are used for assistance during software development.

We will get more familiar with the *npm* tool and additional dependency nuances in the [third part of the course](/part3).

### Axios and promises

Now we are ready to use Axios.
Going forward, we will assume that *json-server* is running on port 3001.

> **Pertinent**: To run *json-server* and your React app simultaneously, you will need to use ***two terminal windows***.
> One to keep *json-server* running and the other to run vite.
> Normally I have a third terminal window open as well to work with *git* to push changes and amend commits.

The library can be brought into use the same way other libraries, e.g. React, are, i.e., by using an appropriate `import` statement.

Add the following to the file *main.jsx*:

```js
import axios from 'axios'

const promise = axios.get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')
console.log(promise)

const promise2 = axios.get('http://localhost:3001/foobar')
console.log(promise2)
```

If you open <http://localhost:5173/> in the browser, this should be printed to the console

![promises printed to console](../../images/2/16b.png)

Notice when the content of the file *main.jsx* changes,
React does not always notice that automatically, **so you might need to refresh the browser to see your changes!**
A simple workaround to make React notice the change automatically is to create a file named *.env* in the root directory of the project and add this line `FAST_REFRESH=false`.
While you are at it, you can also add the following line `BROWSER=none` if you don't want a browser to be launched every time you run `npm start`.
Restart the app for the applied changes to take effect.

The axios method `get` returns a [**promise**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises).

The documentation on Mozilla's site states the following about promises:

> *A [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)*
> *is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.*

In other words, a promise is an object that represents an asynchronous operation.
***A promise can have three distinct states***:

1. **pending**: the final value (one of the following two) is not available yet.
2. **fulfilled**: the operation has been completed and the final value is available; also called **resolved**.
3. **rejected**: an error prevented the final value from being determined, which generally represents a failed operation.

The first promise in our code, *`axios.get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')`*, is ***fulfilled***, which represents a successful request.
The second one, however, *`axios.get('http://localhost:3001/foobar')`* is ***rejected***, and the console tells us the reason.
It looks like we were trying to make an HTTP GET request to a non-existent address.

If, and when, we want to access the result of the operation represented by the promise, **we must register an event handler to the promise**.
This is achieved using the method `then`:

```js
const promise = axios.get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')

promise.then(response => {
  console.log(response)
})
```

The following is printed to the console:

![json object data printed to console](../../images/2/17e.png)

The JavaScript runtime environment calls the callback function registered by the `then` method providing it with a `response` object as a parameter.
The `response` object contains all the essential data related to the response of an HTTP GET request,
which would include the returned ***data***, ***status code***, and ***headers***.

Storing the promise object in a variable is generally unnecessary.
It's more common to chain the `then` method call to the `axios` method call, so that it follows it directly:

```js
axios.get('http://localhost:3001/tasks').then(response => {
  const tasks = response.data
  console.log(tasks)
})
```

The callback function now takes the data contained within the response, stores it in a variable, and prints the tasks to the console.

A more readable way to format ***chained*** method calls is to place each call on its own line:

```js
axios
  .get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')
  .then(response => {
    const tasks = response.data
    console.log(tasks)
  })
```

The data returned by the server is plain text, basically just one long string.
The axios library is still able to parse the data into a JavaScript array,
since the server has specified that the data format is `application/json; charset=utf-8` (see the previous image) using the `content-type` header.

We can finally begin using the data fetched from the server.

Let's try and request the tasks from our local server and render them, initially as the `App` component.
Consider that this approach has many issues, as we're rendering the entire `App` component *only when we successfully retrieve a response* 🧐🤢:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import axios from 'axios' // highlight-line

import App from './App'

axios.get('http://localhost:3001/tasks').then(response => {
  const tasks = response.data
  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App tasks={tasks} />)
})
```

Let's instead move the fetching of the data into the `App` component.

What's not immediately obvious, however, *is where the command `axios.get` should be placed within the component*.

### Effect-hooks

We have already used [**state hooks**](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory)
that were introduced along with React version [16.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react/v/16.8.0),
which provide state to React components defined as functions - the so-called **functional components**.
Version 16.8.0 also introduces [**effect hooks**](https://react.dev/reference/react#effect-hooks) as a new feature.
As per the official docs:

> *Effects let a component [connect to and synchronize with external systems](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects).*
> *This includes dealing with **network**, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.*

As such, effect hooks are precisely the right tool to use when fetching data from a server.

Let's remove the fetching of data from *main.jsx*.
Since we're gonna be retrieving the tasks from the server, there is no longer a need to pass data as props to the `App` component.
So *main.jsx* can be simplified to:

```js
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
```

The `App` component changes as follows:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react' // highlight-line
import axios from 'axios' // highlight-line
import Task from './components/Task'

const App = () => { // highlight-line
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]) // highlight-line
  const [newTask, setNewTask] = useState('')
  const [showAll, setShowAll] = useState(true)

// highlight-start
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('use effect')
    axios
      .get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')
      .then(response => {
        console.log('promise fulfilled')
        setTasks(response.data)
      })
  }, [])

  console.log('rendered', tasks.length, 'tasks')
// highlight-end

  // ...
}
```

We have also added a few helpful prints, which clarify the progression of the execution.

This is printed to the console:

```shell
rendered 0 tasks
use effect
promise fulfilled
rendered 3 tasks
```

First, the body of the function defining the component is executed and the component is rendered for the first time.
At this point `render 0 tasks` is printed, meaning *data hasn't been fetched from the server yet*.

The following ***function***, (*AKA **effect** in React parlance*):

```js
() => {
  console.log('use effect')
  axios
    .get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')
    .then(response => {
      console.log('promise fulfilled')
      setTasks(response.data)
    })
}
```

is executed immediately after rendering.
The execution of the function results in `effect` being printed to the console,
and the command `axios.get` initiates the fetching of data from the server as well as registers the following function as an *event handler* for the operation:

```js
response => {
  console.log('promise fulfilled')
  setTasks(response.data)
})
```

When data arrives from the server, the JavaScript runtime calls the function registered as the event handler,
which prints `promise fulfilled` to the console and stores the tasks received from the server into the state using the function `setTasks(response.data)`.

As always, ***a call to a state-updating function triggers the re-rendering of the component***.
As a result, `render 3 tasks` is printed to the console, and the tasks fetched from the server are rendered to the screen.

Finally, let's take a look at the definition of the effect hook as a whole:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('use effect')
  axios
    .get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')
    .then(response => {
      console.log('promise fulfilled')
      setTasks(response.data)
    })
}, [])
```

Let's rewrite the code a bit differently.

```js
const hook = () => { // highlight-line
  console.log('effect')
  axios
    .get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')
    .then(response => {
      console.log('promise fulfilled')
      setTasks(response.data)
    })
}

useEffect(hook, []) // highlight-line
```

Now we can see more clearly that the function [`useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) takes **two parameters**.
The first is a function, the ***effect*** itself.
According to the documentation:

> *By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire it only when certain values have changed.*

So by default, the effect is ***always*** run after the component has been rendered.
In our case, however, we only want to execute the effect along with the first render.

The second parameter of `useEffect` is used to [specify how often the effect is run](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#parameters).
If the second parameter is an empty array `[]`, then the effect is only run along with the first render of the component.

There are many possible use cases for an effect hook other than fetching data from the server.
However, this use is sufficient for us, for now.

Think back to the sequence of events we just discussed.
**Which parts of the code are run? In what order? How often?**
Understanding the order of events is critical!
***Please use this as a piece of discussion with your teammates and re-review this section.***

> **Notice:** that we could have also written the code for the effect function this way:
>
> ```js
> useEffect(() => {
>   console.log('effect')
> 
>   const eventHandler = response => {
>     console.log('promise fulfilled')
>     setTasks(response.data)
>   }
> 
>   const promise = axios.get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')
>   promise.then(eventHandler)
> }, [])
> ```
>
> A reference to an event handler function is assigned to the variable `eventHandler`.
> The promise returned by the `get` method of Axios is stored in the variable `promise`.
> The registration of the callback happens by giving the `eventHandler` variable,
> referring to the event-handler function, as a parameter to the `then` method of the promise.
> It is unnecessary to assign functions and promises to variables;
> the compact way we used (shown again below) is sufficient.
>
> ```js
> useEffect(() => {
>   console.log('use effect')
>   axios
>     .get('http://localhost:3001/tasks')
>     .then(response => {
>       console.log('promise fulfilled')
>       setTasks(response.data)
>     })
> }, [])
> ```

We still have a problem with our application.
When adding new tasks, they are not stored on the server.

The code for the application, as described so far, can be found in full on
[github](https://github.com/comp227/part2-tasks/tree/part2-4), on branch *part2-4*.

> **Pertinent:** - For the shared files, you may have noticed that
> we shared the *.env* file.
> *.env* files are not normally shared.
> They are often placed in a *.gitignore* file and never added in the first place.
> We will follow this strategy in [part 3](/part3), but I wanted you to see the *.env* file we discussed on this page.

### The development runtime environment

The configuration for the whole application has steadily grown more complex.
Let's review what happens and where.
The following image describes the application's structure.

![diagram of composition of react app](../../images/2/18e.png)

The JavaScript code making up our React application is run in the browser.
The browser gets the JavaScript from the *React dev server*, which is the application that runs after running the command `npm run dev`.
React dev server transforms the JavaScript into a format understood by the browser.
Among other things, it stitches together JavaScript from different files into one file.
We'll discuss the dev server in more detail in [part 7](/part7) of the course.

The React application running in the browser also fetches the JSON formatted data via *localhost:3001/tasks*.
We connected that handle to the json-server we installed and ran.
In *package.json* we also told *json-server* to retrieve its data from the file *db.json*.

At this point in development, all the parts of the application happen to reside on the software developer's machine, otherwise known as ***localhost***.
The situation changes when the application is deployed to the internet.
We will do this in [part 3](/part3).

### Exercise 2.11

#### 2.11: The Communities Step 6

We continue with developing our community directory.
Store the initial state of the application in the file *db.json*, which should be placed in the root of the project.

Start *json-server* on port *`3001`* and make sure that the server returns the list of people by going to the address <http://localhost:3001/groups> in the browser.

> **Remember**: If you receive the following error message:
>
> ```js
> events.js:182
>       throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
>       ^
>
> Error: listen EADDRINUSE 0.0.0.0:3001
>     at Object._errnoException (util.js:1019:11)
>     at _exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:1041:20)
> ```
>
> it means that port 3001 is already in use by another application, e.g. in use by an already running json-server.
> Close the other application, or change the port in case that doesn't work.

Modify the application such that the *initial state of the data is fetched from the server using the `axios` library*.
Complete the fetching with an [**Effect hook**](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect).
